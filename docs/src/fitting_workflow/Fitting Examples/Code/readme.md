# Skipt for running Particel model fit

This code automates the process of fitting Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) data using the bivalent Particle-based model. 
It reads SPR experimental files, fits the data to extract kinetic parameters, and saves the results. The fitting process uses a surrogate model from a lookup table (LUT) and allows for the comparison of a monovalent model if desired. 
The code is intended for batch processing, enabling the analysis of multiple SPR experiments efficiently.

## Requirements

Programming Language: Julia
Libraries: SPRFitting, Plots, DataFrames, XLSX, CSV, DelimitedFiles

## Input Files

The script processes aligned SPR curves. Column include: time, response of concentration 1, time,  response of concentration 2, ... 
The column headers have to be: time, [concentration 1], time, [concentration 2], ...
The data has been aligned to dissociation start, cut to 600 sec, and a few seconds at start and end of injection have been removed to remove artefacts due to injection. 

### File Naming Convention:
The algorithm expects files to follow a specific naming format to extract concentration details:
Data_FC[1-4]_[Date]_Protein[No]_[AB name]_Ligand-[AG name]-[AG conc]_aligned.csv.

All files need to be stored in the following dicrectory hirarchy: 
Experiment/[experiment name]/Aligned/


## User input

### Experiment identifiers
- Experiment Name (experiment_name): The name of the folder containing SPR files to be processed. All files in this folder will be analyzed.

### Fitting Configuration:
- Surrogate Model (LUTfilename): The name of the surrogate file (LUT) used for fitting. The file should be located in the "Surrogates" folder.
- Parameter Bounds (logCP_optrange and optpar_ranges) (optional): Define the search space for the parameters in log scale. The algorithm uses these bounds to optimize the fitting parameters. The algorithm can automatically extract the parameter bounds used for the surrogate model and use them for fitting. 
- nfits: Number of fitting iterations to perform. The fit with the lowest fitness score is selected.
- nsims: Number of simulations to generate when visualizing fits.
- save_curves: Boolean flag whether to save the fitted curves.
- visualise: Boolean flag whether to visualize the fitting process.
- mono_optimiser: Optional monovalent model fitting configuration.

## Output

The algorithm creates a new folder "Fitted", where all output files are stored. 
The following files are created:

### Best Fit:
[filename]_fit.xlsx
For each SPR file, the code saves the fitted curves (both for the bivalent and monovalent model fit) (Sheet 1) and the best-fitting parameters (Sheet 2) in an Excel file.
Parameters saved include fitness score, kon, koff, konb, reach, and CP.

## All Parameters 
[filename]_Params.xlsx
For each SPR file, a CSV file containing the returned parameters from all nfits fitting iterations is saved. This can be used for quality control. 

### Visualizations:
[filename]_curves.png /[filename]_curves_monovalent.png
If enabled, the code saves visualizations of the fitted curves as PNG files.
Both bivalent and monovalent fits (if applicable) are visualized.

###Â Best Fit Parameters:
[experiment_name]_BestParams.csv
A CSV file is created that compiles the best-fitting parameters from all SPR files analyzed.


## How to Run

Set the experiment_name to the folder containing your SPR files.
Specify the LUTfilename for the surrogate model.
Adjust the fitting configuration (e.g., nfits, nsims) as needed.
Ensure your SPR files follow the required naming convention.
Run the script through the terminal: julia ParameterFitting_Example.jl
