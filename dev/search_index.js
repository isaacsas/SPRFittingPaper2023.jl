As described in [1], our general approach will be to use the XNES optimizer from BlackBoxOptim.jl to minimize the difference between the SPR data and the surrogate's predicted SPR traces. XNES is a stochastic natural evolution optimizer that we have found often gives the best fits among many optimizer choices. We use this optimizer via Optimization.jl, which allows for the easy selection of different optimizer choices. As XNES is stochastic, we will run the parameter estimation process nfits times, and select parameters from the run with the minimal loss as our final estimates.
